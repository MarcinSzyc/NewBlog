# Project Title

This is an learning project based on several tutorials found on internet.
Its main goal is to test the waters and play with Ruby on Rails design. As a proof of concept it is trying to mimic functionality of a blog.

## Getting Started

Download and run it on every localhost instance. Install Postgress and run Bundle Install.

### Prerequisites

Aplication run on Ruby 2.3.3p222 and Rails 5.1.6. I have added following GEMS:

* Devise - for authentication. I used login view only but it gives uniqure view and access to specific parts of the application.
* Bootstrap - for styling and navbar. I used also styles related to buttons.
* jquery-rails - added to support bootstrap styling.
* friendly_id - suggested by Stephen Fiser add in for post-id management. It allows to use user provided names for generating posts. That     gives preety nice experience with using blog.

## Running the tests

Use navbar for navigation and test working navigation. After sign in you can create new post, update and remove existing ones. Posts allow for adding text and pictures.
